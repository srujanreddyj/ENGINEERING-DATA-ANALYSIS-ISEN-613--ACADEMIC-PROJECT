# ENGINEERING-DATA-ANALYSIS-ISEN-613--ACADEMIC-PROJECT
#### This is an academic project done as a part of ENGINEERING-DATA-ANALYSIS course at TEXAS A&M UNIVERSITY. ####

Project Goal
----
"Image classification" using various machine learning concepts that are taught in the classroom. 
  * We applied random forest, PCA, logistic regression, KNN, ensemble methods
  * We also implemented Deep learning concepts in R on cifar10 dataset to train a CNN model using keras and tensorflow.
  * Achieved an accuracy of 85%.
  * Our deep learning model consisted of 6 layers model.

Data Source
----
CIFAR 10 (provided by the professor)
